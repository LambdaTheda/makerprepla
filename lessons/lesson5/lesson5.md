# Lesson 5: CSS Frameworks

Okay, so we've learned that doing layout with CSS by hand is confusing, inconsistent between different browsers, resolutions and devices and just generally a great, big pain in the butt. Well...

**Good news everyone! CSS Frameworks exist!** A framework (or library) just means "a bunch of pre-written code", usually code that solves frequently-encountered problems common to many projects. A **lazy** programmer is a **good** programmer. **Don't reinvent the wheel!** *Also, don't slack off in this class.*

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a fully-featured framework that gives us pre-written CSS and JavaScript code (we'll just focus on the CSS for now). The CSS alone consists of [8000+ lines of code!!!](http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.css)

This will be an exercise in ignoring complexity* and zeroing to finding only the information you need to take the next step forward. (**Hint:** Try using [CMD + F] to search [Bootstrap's CSS documentation page](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) for each bolded term below.)

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

You can make this page about anything, but if you're lacking inspiration [may I suggest...](https://www.google.com/search?q=adorable+animals&tbm=isch)

1. Add the above link code to the head of a fresh HTML document.
2. rowse through the documentation of the CSS portion of Boostrap.
3. Create a simple **grid system** for your page.
4. Create a section of **lead body copy**
5. Use some **marked text**
6. Use some **text alignment** classes
7. Create a table with **striped rows**
8. Use some **button classes**
9. Try a few **image shapes**
10. Make an eye-catching **jumbotron**
11. Setup a formspree form like the previous lesson, but this time *more beautiful*

## Extra Credit:

+ Check out Bootstraps pre-built [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) and set some of them up on your page. A particularly popular component is [navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar).

+ Find a bootstrap template that you like, and try to modify it to suit your needs. Did you learn anything by looking at someone elses code?

+ Check out [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and see if you can get one of their custom Bootstrap themes set up.
