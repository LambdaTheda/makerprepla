# Lesson 18: Choose Your Own Adventure

Todays lesson will be different than our usual lessons. Instead of covering a particular topic like we usually do, you're free to choose what you would like to work on today. Regardless of what you choose, the instructor will be available to help you to the best of their ability.

Some recommendations:

1. If you're still feeling shaky on JavaScript fundamentals, now would be a great time to review some of the following topics: Objects, Functions, Arrays, and Loops. Previous MakerPrep lessons or CodeAcademy would be a great way to review these topics. Also, feel free to review any of the previous lessons that you wish you'd had more time to spend on.

2. If you haven't finished it yet, working on [LearnRx](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/) would be great.

3. If you want more practice with making single-page applications, you could go back to the AJAX & JSON lesson and finish all the exercises.

4. If you want to learn more about objects, go back to the object-oriented JavaScript lesson and do the extra credit reading (as well as the exercises at the end) about prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

4. If you feel like you have a strong understanding of fundamental JavaScript, functional programming, and object-oriented programming (including prototypal inheritance in JavaScript), then search the internet to learn about **linked lists** and then use [this skeleton](resources/linked_list.js) to implement your own!
