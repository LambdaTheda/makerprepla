# Lesson Plan 20

Today is the last day of MakerPrep so I thought we would focus on some particularly difficult recursion problems. Kidding. We started from pretty much nothing, and have covered Markdown, HTML, CSS, CSS frameworks like bootstrap, basic JavaScript, QuerySelectors, Objects, Arrays, JQuery, Events / asynchronous programming, AJAX and JSON, Functional Programming, Object Oriented Programming, and Firebase. You all even got a taste of Git and Bash! I think you should all be really proud of yourselves. You all came from different skill levels and I've personally watched each one of you improve greatly compared to day 1. Seriously, take a moment to consider what you could do on day 1, and what you know how to accomplish now.

I know some of you were asking me about how to write "pretty" JavaScript, so we can take a quic skim through the airbnb style guide and then you guys can read the full thing on your own later. [Do that, make sure you do the es5 one not the es6 one]

The next thing I want to talk about is what you guys can do moving forward now that the class is over. At the top of the lesson I have a few recommendations but the gist is this:

If your number one goal is to get into MakerPrep then I would focus on nailing down core javascript and functional programming. Get through learnRx, polish up your fundamentals, do problems on codewars. In addition, building your own personal projects is always a great idea as it gives you a real taste of web development and tells you if you really like this stuff.

If you just want to keep learning about web development, then again, the number one thing you can do is take on some kind of project. Just find an idea that you like and are passionate about and that will motivate you, and ***build it***. You can start with just JQuery and Firebase, and learn the new pieces that you need as you go. Eventually, its always great to pickup a framework like Angular, React, Ember, Meteor, or even DJango / Ruby on Rails (which aren't even in JavaScript!)

We're also providing you with this document about how to look for a job in this market and industry. You'd be surprised at your ability to find a simple web development job after practicing for a few months. I didn't write this document, but its basically like a very very condensed version of the kind of interview, salary negotiation, and job search training that we give our full-time MakerSquare students. [Briefly skim through the document with them]

Finally, I just want to let you all know that its been a pleasure teaching this class. I really learned a lot from you guys and its been awesome watching you guys struggle and get better ever night. Keep track of my email address and phone number, add me on linkedin / facebook. I'll always make myself available to ya'll as a resource. If you have any questions about programming, JavaScript, web deevelopment, computer science, the industry, your personal project, anything, just let me know and I'll be happy to help you with the limited knowledge that I have. That being said, if you guys have any questions, about the program or anything else, now would be a great time to ask.
