# Teaching Tips

1. Constantly remind students **not** to copy and paste code. Its for their own benefit to write everything out.

2. Encourage students to use MDN to look up documentation / syntax when they're confused on how to use something (particularly helpful for HTML/CSS)

3. Text editor shortcut of the day!

4. I brough cookies in every friday

5. Don't say things like "This is a confusing topic" or "Take a minute to wrap your head around this". Be positive and say things like: "The exercises in the lesson will solidify this concept for you."
